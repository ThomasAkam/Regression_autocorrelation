# Correcting for autocorrelation in regression analyses of neuronal data.

This repository contains an Jupyter Python notebook exploring ways of computing P values in regression analyses of neuronal data which correct for the effect of autocorrelation in behavioural and neuronal time series. Such autocorrealtions severely overinflate the number of neurons identified as significantly related to behaviour if P values from a standard regression analysis are used, see [Elber-Dorozko & Loewenstein 2018](https://elifesciences.org/articles/34248).

You should be able to view the notebook in GitHub by just clicking on the file.  If that is not working you can view the notebook using nbviewer [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ThomasAkam/Regression_autocorrelation/blob/master/Regression%20autocorrelation%20correction.ipynb).
